## My process

### Built with

- HTML markup
- CSS properties
- Flexbox
- Desktop-first workflow then mobile-workflow


### What I learned

After completing this challenge, I feel more confident working with HTML and CSS. I've explored different option to make the page look similar. Gained the feel of real world project. I've learned how to analyze the requirement and planning the solution.
Learned how to write README.md file as well.


### Continued development

I still feel that I need to spend some more time on Flexbox and its properties. Need to learn how to design page for specific width and screens.
